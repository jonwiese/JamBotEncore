# JamBotEncore
This is an encore to my semester thesis\
__JamBot: Music Theory Aware Chord Based Generation of Polyphonic Music with LSTMs__ _(https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07682)_ \
that led to a paper that was presented at ICTAI 2017.

__JamBotEncore__ aims to:
- Refactor the original JamBot code to bring it up to current standards.
- Allow experimentation with different machine learning models
(e.g. using transformers instead of LSTMs). 
- Allow for extension, experimentation and being creative. 
- Be used as sample application to experiment with new technologies that I want to explore
(e.g. cloud services, docker, flask).
